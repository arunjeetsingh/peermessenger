1.0.4.0
=======
1. Tcp send/recieve for PeerMessenger now uses the NoDelay flag. Should make PeerMessenger protocol detection snappier (in theory).
2. Better exception handling in the UI forms.
3. The main window isn't owner of conversations any longer. Hopefully this will fix the issue with conversations windows failing to render after restoring from system tray. Side effect: Minimizing main window has no affect on conversation windows now.
4. Implemented the new search feature to search through contacts.

1.0.5.0
=======
1. Show the user an error message and quit if the required ports aren't available at startup. Right now, this condition leads to a dead application.
2. Implement window flashing to notify user of new messages.
