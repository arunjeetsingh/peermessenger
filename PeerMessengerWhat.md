application.
  * Exchange profile pictures with other Peer Messenger users
  * Let the user quickly search through the list of Peer Messenger/IP Messenger peers
  * Send "Sealed" messages to IP Messenger users
  * Transfer files to/from Peer Messenger and IP Messenger peers
  * Huge overall improvement to IP Messenger's dated interface (at least according to me)


**What it can't do (yet)**
  * Multicast messages. Can only send messages to one user at a time
  * Encryption. All messages are sent/received in plain text
