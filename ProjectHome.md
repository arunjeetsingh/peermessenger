Peer Messenger is a LAN based peer to peer messenger along the lines of IP Messenger (http://www.ipmsg.org/index.html.en). The goal is to do the same thing IP Messenger does but with a better interface and in .NET.

One of the immediate objectives of the project is to support the IP Messenger protocol as fully as possible so that people who work in environments where IPMsg is used can use Peer Messenger as a drop-in replacement.

A more far-fetched objective is to also implement Jabber (http://www.jabber.org/) support so that Peer Messenger can be used to connect with Jabber-based services such as Google Talk.x
