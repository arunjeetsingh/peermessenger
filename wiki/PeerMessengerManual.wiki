#summary The PeerMessenger Manual

= Introduction =

This manual briefly covers the features available in the latest version of PeerMessenger.
Version numbers where a feature first appeared are noted alongside the feature itself.
Because I believe its easiest to learn UIs using scenarios I have tried to structure the
whole thing as a series of How-tos.
